<H2>Libundo Development Roadmap</H2>

<P>
The current release of Libundo is 0.8.0.  The code in this release is
The Simplest Thing Which Could Possibly Work.  It is very sub-optimal
in both execution speed and memory usage.  However, the API as it
exists in 0.8.0 is likely to be very close to the 1.0.0 API.  The code
is feature complete.  No new major features will be added before
1.0.0.  This release is intended to provide application developers
with a library to begin using in application development, with the
acknowledgement that the performance is not yet what it could be.

<P>
<H2>0.8.x</H2>

<P>
For the remainder of the 0.8.x series, the goal is to optimize the
performance of libundo, in both speed and memory, to the point that
libundo is useful for applications with large amounts of undoable data
and a wide variety of memory allocation strategies.

<P>
It is likely that Libundo will be modified to use zlib or a similar
compression library to compress memory heap snapshots.  We will
investigate storing memory deltas between sequential snapshots for
even tighter memory usage.  The memory allocation algorithms used by
the memory heap routines will also be improved for speed.  A better
<TT>undo_realloc()</TT> will be provided which can potentially reuse
existing memory locations.  There may be other optimization
opportunities as well.

<P>
<H2>0.9.x</H2>

<P>
When Libundo is reasonably optimized, we will enter the 0.9.x series.
The goal of 0.9.x is simply to clean up any remaining bugs and be sure
about the Libundo API before it is frozen in 1.0.0.  Example
applications will be written to provide easy illustration of the use
of libundo.  When we are confident about the quality of the code and
the API, and some reasonable example applications are available, we
will release 1.0.0.

<P>
<H2>1.x.x</H2>

<P>
Libundo was designed with a quite simple interface and feature set to
promote rapid development.  It is hoped that 1.0.0 will be available
in the reasonably near future.  After the 1.0.0 release, all future
versions of Libundo will support the 1.0.0 API for backwards
compatibility.  

<P>
If Libundo is successful enough to warrant continued development, the
1.1.x series will be the first to add new features to libundo.
