<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Multilevel undo is unquestionably a very valuable tool which allows
users to fearlessly explore changes to their data without worry about
the details of not being able to recover from mistakes.  It is no
wonder that many of today's users expect their applications to
seamlessly support multilevel undo/redo.  

<P>
Unfortunately for users, many application developers implement
undo/redo poorly or not at all.  When it is implemented, it is often
done so in an ad hoc fasion, with each possible program operation
having associated code to perform undo and redo actions.  This is
additional code which must be written, debugged and supported.  Some
application writers simplify the problem of managing undo information
by only implementing single level undo, or by not implementing any
sort of undo!  Because of the complexity of properly managing
undo/redo, the users suffer.

<P>
Libundo is a simple, easy-to-use library which manages recording and
playback of undo/redo information for application developers.  It is
designed to be simple to plug in to existing applications and require
only a minimal amount of support code be written to support
multi-level undo/redo.  Libundo handles all the details of determining
what has changed after an undoable action is performed, recording that
information and saving it for use when an undo is performed.  Libundo
makes it easy for application writers to give end users what they
want.

<P>
Libundo is available under the GNU GPL and is not tied to any GUI
libraries or application frameworks.  Libundo has a C&nbsp;language
interface.  Libundo does require the ability to do Unix-style
memory&nbsp;mapping.


<P>
<H2>Libundo Basics</H2>

<P>
Libundo works by managing an alternate memory allocation heap.
Through the functions <TT>undo_malloc()</TT> and <TT>undo_free()</TT>
you are able to allocate and free memory, just like the standard
functions <TT>malloc()</TT> and <TT>free()</TT>.  The difference is
that through the <TT>undo_snapshot()</TT> function call, the current
state of the memory heap can be recorded and saved for later
restoration.

<P>
It is expected that you will use <TT>undo_malloc()</TT> to allocate
all memory used to store state of the document your application
operates on.  Immediately after you initialize a new document, you
will call <TT>undo_snapshot()</TT> to record the original document
state.  Similarly, as the last step of each operation which modifies
your document data, you will call <TT>undo_snapshot()</TT> to record the
changes you have made while performing that action.

<P>
At a later time, when the application user requests that the last
action be undone, you will call the function <TT>undo_undo()</TT> and
Libundo will use the recorded snapshots to undo the one action.  When
the user requests a redo, you will call <TT>undo_redo()</TT>, and one
undone action will be redone.  Note that when you call
<TT>undo_undo()</TT> or <TT>undo_redo()</TT>, undo memory will be
allocated and freed as recorded by your previous snapshots.


<P>
<H2>Session Management</H2>

<P>
Before you can allocate any undoable memory, you must first create an
undo session and set a memory limit.  The <TT>undo_new()</TT> function
allows you to create an undo session and <TT>undo_destroy()</TT> will
destroy the active undo session.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>int undo_new(char *session_name);</TT><BR>
	<TT>int undo_destroy(void);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<TT>undo_new()</TT> will create a new session with the given
<TT>session_name</TT>.  <TT>session_name</TT> should be a
non-<TT>NULL</TT> character string describing the document.  The
filename the document was read from might be appropriate.  The
<TT>session_name</TT> isn't currently used by Libundo, but future
versions may include crash-recovery features.  The
<TT>session_name</TT> would be used to identify documents from
previously crashed sessions.

<P>
There also exist functions to manage which undo session is currently
active.  <TT>undo_get_session()</TT> will return the current session while
<TT>undo_set_session()</TT> will set the currently active session.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>UNDO *undo_get_session(void);</TT><BR>
	<TT>int undo_set_session(UNDO *undo);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If your application has multiple documents open, you will likely have
a distinct undo session for each document.  Before you call any other
undo related functions, you will want to first call
<TT>undo_set_session()</TT> so that you are sure that the proper
session is activated.

<P>
Finally, each undo session has an associated memory limit.  Use
<TT>undo_set_memory_limit()</TT> to set this limit.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>int undo_set_memory_limit(size_t max_memory);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This limit is used to determine how many recorded snapshots are kept
by the undo session.  Libundo will discard old snapshots as necessary
to keep its snapshot history under the specified limit.  You must specify
a memory limit before you make any calls to <TT>undo_snapshot()</TT>.


<P>
<H2>Memory Management</H2>

<P>
The interface and operation of <TT>undo_malloc()</TT>,
<TT>undo_realloc()</TT> and <TT>undo_free()</TT> should be familiar to
any C&nbsp;language programmer.  They are designed to be drop-in
replacements for <TT>malloc()</TT>, <TT>realloc()</TT> and
<TT>free()</TT> when operating on undoable data.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>void *undo_malloc(size_t size);</TT><BR>
	<TT>void *undo_realloc(void *mem, size_t size);</TT><BR>
	<TT>void undo_free(void *mem);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There shouldn't be any surprises here.  Each of these functions
behaves the same as its C&nbsp;library counterpart, except it uses the
memory heap of the currently active undo&nbsp;session.

<P>
The only memory management function without a C&nbsp;library
counterpart is <TT>undo_snapshot()</TT>.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>int undo_snapshot(void);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<TT>undo_snapshot()</TT> simply records state of the current undo
session's memory heap, including information about what blocks are
currently allocated.  It will honor the memory limit set by
<TT>undo_set_memory_limit()</TT>.  This recorded snapshot can be
played back later by <TT>undo_undo()</TT>.


<P>
<H2>Undo/Redo</H2>

<P>
After more than one snapshot has been recorded by
<TT>undo_snapshot()</TT>, <TT>undo_undo()</TT> and
<TT>undo_redo()</TT> can be used.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>int undo_undo(void);</TT><BR>
	<TT>int undo_redo(void);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Both functions simply restore the state of the current session's
memory heap to that which is represented by the appropriate snapshot.
Memory allocated by <TT>undo_malloc()</TT> may be freed or reallocated
as a result of calling <TT>undo_undo()</TT> or <TT>undo_redo()</TT>.
Be careful that you don't have references to undoable memory which
might be freed in non-undoable memory.

<P>
The functions <TT>undo_get_undo_count()</TT> and
<TT>undo_get_redo_count()</TT> are also provided.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>unsigned undo_get_undo_count(void);</TT><BR>
	<TT>unsigned undo_get_redo_count(void);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These functions simply return the numbers of times your application
can expect to undo or redo undoable actions from the current point in
the undo stack of the active session.  These can be useful to set
undo/redo menu items and buttons in your GUI to insensitive when there
are no undos or redos possible.


<P>
<H2>Error Recovery</H2>

<P>
The above Libundo functions which return the type <TT>int</TT> all
return standard Libundo error codes.

<P>
<PRE>
	<TT>#define UNDO_NOERROR        0   /* No error */</TT>
	<TT>#define UNDO_BADPARAM       1   /* Bad parameter passed to function */</TT>
	<TT>#define UNDO_NOMEM          2   /* Not enough memory */</TT>
	<TT>#define UNDO_NOSESSION      3   /* No undo session */</TT>
	<TT>#define UNDO_NODO           4   /* Nothing to undo/redo */</TT>
	<TT>#define UNDO_NOLIMIT        5   /* No memory limit specified */</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
The Libundo functions which return pointers will return <TT>NULL</TT>
when Libundo experiences an error.  In the case of either type of
function, <TT>undo_get_errcode()</TT> can be used to retrieve the
error code for the last error.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>int undo_get_errcode(void);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Note that calling <TT>undo_get_errcode()</TT> will reset the state of
Libundo such that <TT>undo_get_errcode()</TT> will return
<TT>UNDO_NOERROR</TT> the next time it is called if there hasn't been
another error.

<P>
As a convenience to you, Libundo provides a function for converting
from a numeric undo error code to an English string describing the error.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<TT>char *undo_strerror(int errcode);</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<TT>undo_strerror()</TT> will return a null terminated string with a 
newline at the end suitable for printing in the case of an error.


<P>
<H2>The Future of Libundo</H2>

<P>
Future versions of Libundo may include application crash recovery
though the saving of snapshots to disk.  Hooks may be provided so that
applications can register callbacks to be executed at undo and redo
time to perform actions which aren't easily mapped into the
<TT>undo_malloc()</TT> paradigm.  Similarly, future versions of
Libundo may be able to watch regions of memory for changes to ease
integration with applications which use <TT>mmap()</TT> to map files
into memory.  If you've got an opinion about which extensions to
Libundo would be useful and which are unnecessary, I'd love to hear
it.
